# BRIEF SUMMARY
    The name of the this application is called Wavelength. This web aplication is a simple but highly functional electronic medical record system that could be implemented at a small urgent care center or emergency room. Our user experience is both provider- and patient-centric, creating a logical organizational structure that will help streamline workflow for providers and facilitate a more integrated care-delivery system for each patient.


# USER-EXPERIENCE
    -The user will be greeted by our application's intro page. From there, the user will be able to sign into our application using google authentication. 

    -Based on the user's administration status certain features will or will not be available to said user. 

    -Assuming the user is of administration status, the user will be able to view all patients admitted in our EMR system record at the patient index page. Patients can also be added from the patient index page, where the user will be taken to a form to fill out all required information on the soon to be admitted patient. The user will also be able to filter patients based on their admission status(admitted or discharged) or all patients on record. If the user selected the "all patients" feature, the index will present all patients on record regradless of admission status. Patients will be highlighted in a light grey tint based on their discharged status( discharged patients will be light grey)

    -once the patient is admitted, the user will be able to view the patients facesheet by selecting the name of that patient from the index. 

    -In the patient's facesheet, the user will be able to view that patients current assigned healthcare providers. the user can add vitals to the patient or delete an already added set of vitals from that patient's facesheet. This is also the location where the user can also discharge the patient. 

    -if the user uses the nav bar to navigate to the providers, they will be taken to the providers index. Here, base on the user's    
    administration status, the user will be able to see the list of all current users as well as add new users or edit current users

    -if the user navigates to add users, the user will be able to create a user. The user has the option to allow Administration priviledges to the user. 
    
    -if the user navigated to edit users, they would be able to make changes to the user, such as job title and admin status.

    -if the user clicked on the name of the user/provider, the user will be able to view that user's profile. Within the profile, the user will be able to edit the user(synonumous function as "edit user" at the provider index), unassign current patients, or assign new patients using the drop down and clicking the button "assign patient".
