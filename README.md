# Wavelength EMR

The name of the this application is called Wavelength. This web aplication is a simple but highly functional electronic medical record system that could be implemented at a small urgent care center or emergency room. Our user experience is both provider- and patient-centric, creating a logical organizational structure that will help streamline workflow for providers and facilitate a more integrated care-delivery system for each patient.

### Patient Index
The user will be able to view all patients admitted in our EMR system record at the patient index page. Patients can also be added from the patient index page, where the user will be taken to a form to fill out all required information on the soon to be admitted patient. The user will also be able to filter patients based on their admission status(admitted or discharged) or all patients on record. If the user selected the "all patients" feature, the index will present all patients on record regradless of admission status. Patients will be highlighted in a light grey tint based on their discharged status( discharged patients will be light grey). Once the patient is admitted, the user will be able to view the patients facesheet by selecting the name of that patient from the index.

### Patient Facesheet

In the patient's facesheet, the user will be able to view that patients current assigned healthcare providers. the user can add vitals to the patient or delete an already added set of vitals from that patient's facesheet. The patient's facesheet will also have progress notes so the user will be able to witness the last updated progress notes applied. The progress notes will be seperated into 3 sub-categories: Subjective; Objective; Assessment and Plan. The user can select "add progress note" so that the user will be able to add new set of progress notes or the user can view all progress notes which will take the user to a new page to see all associated progress notes. In the patient facesheet, the user can also discharge the patient. Upon discharging the patient you can automatically generate a discharge summary for the patient which summarizes the patient's hospital stay including assessments, findings, treatments, and discharge instructions. This discharge summary is generated by openAiAPI in combination of all the patients' existing progress notes as documented by the healthcare team.
